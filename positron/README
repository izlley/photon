Multithreaded, evhttp-based http server sample.

(Simple implementaion, not fully tested, may have bugs and design issues)

This is a Multithreaded, evhttp-based http server sample written by Qi Huang.
It is inspired by Ronald Bennett Cemer's multithreaded socket server and has
kept part of his code. A libevent 2.x compatible of his Multithreaded socket
server is also in the same repository.

More to come...
